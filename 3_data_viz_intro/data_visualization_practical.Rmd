**Question 1**

* Provide at least two methods to view the number of rows and the number of columns in the `mpg` dataset.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("mpg")
mpg
# first method
number_row <- nrow (mpg)
number_row
number_column <- ncol (mpg)
number_column
# second method
dimensions <- dim (mpg)
dimensions
total_row <- dimensions [1]
total_row 
total_columns <- dimensions [2]
total_columns 
```

**Question 2**

* Execute the following code:

    ```R
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```

* Identify the issue with the code.
* Correct it so that the plot displays as intended.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Question 3**

Create a `facet grid` to explore how the relationships between `displ` and `hwy` differ among vehicle classes and drive configurations.

To create the facet grid, use the `facet_grid()` function in ggplot2. 
The tilde (~) symbol inside the function specifies which variable is a function of the other. For example, facet_grid(x ~ y) will generate subplots where x varies by row of the facet and y varies by column of the facet.


```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Question 4**

* Create a scatter plot for the variables `cty` (x-axis) and `hwy` (y-axis) from the `mpg` dataset.
* Add a geom to show the linear regression between x and y.
    * Use a linear model (`lm`) instead of the default (`loess`) for computing the regression.
    * Set the line color to `red`.
    * Color the points by `class`.
    * Set the point size to 6.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Question 5**

* In the previous plot, you noticed subcompacts with a city fuel consumption of 15 miles per gallon.
* Extract only the manufacturer and model of these subcompacts.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Question 6**

* The following code generates a warning:

    ```R
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
    ```

* Correct the code so all classes are displayed.
    * Hint: You can manually specify shapes using the `scale_shape_manual` geom.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Question 7**

* Given the following two vectors:

```R
x <- c(3.385,0.48,1.35,465,36.33,27.66,14.83,1.04,4.19,0.425,0.101,0.92,1,0.005,0.06,3.5,2,1.7,2547,0.023,187.1,521,0.785,10,3.3,0.2,1.41,529,207,85,0.75,62,6654,3.5,6.8,35,4.05,0.12,0.023,0.01,1.4,250,2.5,55.5,100,52.16,10.55,0.55,60,3.6,4.288,0.28,0.075,0.122,0.048,192,3,160,0.9,1.62,0.104,4.235)
y <- c(44.5,15.5,8.1,423,119.5,115,98.2,5.5,58,6.4,4,5.7,6.6,0.14,1,10.8,12.3,6.3,4603,0.3,419,655,3.5,115,25.6,5,17.5,680,406,325,12.3,1320,5712,3.9,179,56,17,1,0.4,0.25,12.5,490,12.1,175,157,440,179.5,2.4,81,21,39.2,1.9,1.2,3,0.33,180,25,169,2.6,11.4,2.5,50.4)
```
* Combine the two vectors into a data frame called `sizeMass`.
    * Name the columns as `size` and `mass` respectively.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

* Use the code below to plot the data.

    ```R
    ggplot(sizeMass, aes(size, mass)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE)
    ```

**Question 8**

* Transform the data in the plot to mitigate the "squashed" appearance.

1. Add two new columns named `size_log10` and `mass_log10` containing the log10 values of `size` and `mass`, respectively. Then use these new columns for plotting.

```{r}
# Write your code here (method 1)
```

2. Use `scale_x_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()` to set different scales for the x and y aesthetics.

```{r}
# Write your code here (method 2)
```
